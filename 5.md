## Explain what Index New, Create and Show Routes Markdown Code Block

The index, new, and show routes all are manifestations of the HTTP verb **Get** method. 

### Index Route:

An index route lists all of the files available to the viewer. It can be understood as a table of contents that lists all of the options offered. 

An index route  uses the GET HTTP verb and the mongoose .find method and renders a view called Index.jsx

```JS
// INDEX --- READ --- GET
app.get('/vegetables', (req, res) => {
  Vegetable.find({}, (err, foundVegetables) => {
    if(err){
      console.error(err)
      res.status(400).send(err)
    } else {
      res.render('vegetables/Index', {
        vegetables: foundVegetables
      })
    }
  })
})
```

### New Route

The New route, another GET method,  is used for  displaying the HTML form for creating a new item. Because this route does not rely on the database for information, it does not have a mongoose method. It's url will look like **/vegetables/new** and the rendered view will be  New.jsx.

```JS
// NEW (Not applicable in an api)
app.get('/vegetables/new', (req, res) => {
  res.render('vegetables/New')
})
```



### Show Route

The show route is most succintly summed up in our class notes from W10 D3 as a Slack message from Neil Freeman, **"show: like turning to the page you searched for in the table of contents."**

Because it is showing data on one specific item of the array, it uses the GET HTTP method, like the Index and New routed do. Because the function is to get only **one** of the items, the mongoose method is more specific in this case it is **findOne or .findById**. The functionality of this method is displayed on the Show.jsx page. An example of the code follows: 

```JS
// SHOW ---- READ ---- GET
app.get('/vegetables/:id', (req, res) => {
 Vegetable.findById(req.params.id, (err, foundVegetable) => {
   if(err){
    console.error(err)
    res.status(400).send(err)
   } else {
    res.render('vegetables/Show', {
      vegetable: foundVegetable
    })
   }
 })
})
```
Three of the four uses of the GET verb are summarised in this document. The final method that uses GET is the edit page.
