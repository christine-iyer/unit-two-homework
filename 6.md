### Written HW Big O Natation

**1. What is Big O Notation?** 

**Big O Notation** provides developers with a language/metric to describe algorithm efficiency. The metrics could be described as broad because there are various ways developers evaluate their algo performance, including the number of CPU cycles it requires, the amount of time it requires to run, and how many iterations it requires to complete. For many algorithms, in the case where multiple types of big O notation are invoked, the worst case scenario performance is the default. 

**1. Contrast Big O with Omega and Theta**

**Omega** is the best possible result from an algo at runtime. Many times when an algo renders this at runtime, it can be attributed to luck. 

**Theta** is the expected result from an algo at runtime. 

**Big O** is how we express the worst case result at runtime.

     **1. Linear Time Complexity:** As the size of the input grows, so does the processing time, at a linear pace. Use cases include searching an array, inserting an element into an array, searching the page, or certain downloads. The code snippet below generates a random number based off 2 other arrays. 

     ```JS
     tinyArray = Array(10).fill(0)
     largeArray = Array(100000000).fill(0)
     findFifthElementOfArray(tinyArray)
     findFifthElementOfArray(largeArray)
     function findFifthElementOfArray(arr) {
          return arr[4]
     }
     ```

    **2. Quadratic Time Complexity:** Each time the input grows, processing time increases exponentially. In the case where this is the runtime result, the process should be reevaluated and the algo avoided. Below is a code example that loops through a 2 D array.

     ```JS
     const fakeTwoDimensionArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
     logArray(fakeTwoDimensionArray)
     function logArray(arr) {
          for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
               console.log(arr[i])
               for(let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++){
                    console.log("i: ", arr[i], "j: ", arr[j])
               }
          }
     }
     ```
