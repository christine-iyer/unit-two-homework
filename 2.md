**1XX** Informational
**2XX** Successful

### What are the Primary HTTP Verbs and what do they mean? 
HTTP verbs are a collection of methods, each of which indicate the desired action to be performed on a given resource (as specified by the url) on the server. 

HTTP methods are used to define our application's routes. 

| HTTP Method      | Desired Action on the Server |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| GET      | The GET method requests the representation of a specified URL. GET requests retrieve data        |
| POST  | The POST method is used to create a resource on the server.        |
| PUT      | The PUT method is used to replace a resource with the data in the body (the request payload).        |
| DELETE   | The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.        |
